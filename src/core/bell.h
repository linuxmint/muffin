 * Sometimes, X programs "ring the bell", whatever that means. Muffin lets
 * the user configure the bell to be audible or visible (aka visual), and
 * if it's visual it can be configured to be frame-flash or fullscreen-flash.
 * We never get told about audible bells; X handles them just fine by itself.
 *
 * The visual bell was the result of a discussion in Bugzilla here:
 * <http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99886>.
