/* In GTK+-3.0, the error trapping code was significantly rewritten. The new code
 * has some neat features (like knowing automatically if a sync is needed or not
 * and handling errors asynchronously when the error code isn't needed immediately),
 * but it's basically incompatible with the hacks we played with GTK+-2.0 to
 * use a custom error handler along with gdk_error_trap_push().
 *
 * Since the main point of our custom error trap was to get the error logged
 * to the right place, with GTK+-3.0 we simply omit our own error handler and
 * use the GTK+ handling straight-up.
 * (See https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=630216 for restoring logging.)
