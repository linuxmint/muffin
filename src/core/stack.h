/**
 * \file stack.h  Which windows cover which other windows
 *
 * There are two factors that determine window position.
 * 
 * One is window->stack_position, which is a unique integer
 * indicating how windows are ordered with respect to one
 * another. The ordering here transcends layers; it isn't changed
 * as the window is moved among layers. This allows us to move several
 * windows from one layer to another, while preserving the relative
 * order of the moved windows. Also, it allows us to restore
 * the stacking order from a saved session.
 * 
 * However when actually stacking windows on the screen, the
 * layer overrides the stack_position; windows are first sorted
 * by layer, then by stack_position within each layer.
