   * enough to make this worth bothering.  Further, it is only called from
   * workspace.c:ensure_work_areas_validated (at least as of the time of
   * writing this comment), which in turn should only be called if the
   * strut list changes or the screen or monitor size changes.  If it ever
   * does show up on profiles (most likely because people start using
   * ridiculously huge numbers of partial struts), possible optimizations
   * include:
   *
   * (1) rewrite merge_spanning_rects_in_region() to be O(n) or O(nlogn).
   *     I'm not totally sure it's possible, but with a couple copies of
   *     the list and sorting them appropriately, I believe it might be.
   * (2) only call merge_spanning_rects_in_region() with a subset of the
   *     full list of rectangles.  I believe from some of my preliminary
   *     debugging and thinking about it that it is possible to figure out
   *     apriori groups of rectangles which are only merge candidates with
   *     each other.  (See testboxes.c:get_screen_region() when which==2
   *     and track the steps of this function carefully to see what gave
   *     me the hint that this might work)
   * (3) figure out how to avoid merge_spanning_rects_in_region().  I think
   *     it might be possible to modify this function to make that
   *     possible, and I spent just a little while thinking about it, but n
   *     wasn't large enough to convince me to care yet.
   * (4) Some of the stuff Rob mentioned at http://mail.gnome.org/archives\
   *     /metacity-devel-list/2005-November/msg00028.html.  (Sorry for the
   *     URL splitting.)

   * Now, we need (rx,ry) to be on the line between (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).
   * For that to happen, we first need the slope of the line from (x1,y1)
   * to (rx,ry) must match the slope of (x1,y1) to (x2,y2), i.e.:
   *   (ry-y1)   (y2-y1)
   *   ------- = -------
   *   (rx-x1)   (x2-x1)
   * If x1==x2, though, this gives divide by zero errors, so we want to
   * rewrite the equation by multiplying both sides by (rx-x1)*(x2-x1):
   *   (ry-y1)(x2-x1) = (y2-y1)(rx-x1)
   * This is a valid requirement even when x1==x2 (when x1==x2, this latter
   * equation will basically just mean that rx must be equal to both x1 and
   * x2)
   *
   * The other requirement that we have is that the line from (rx,ry) to
   * (px,py) must be perpendicular to the line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2).  So
   * we just need to get a vector in the direction of each line, take the
   * dot product of the two, and ensure that the result is 0:
   *   (rx-px)*(x2-x1) + (ry-py)*(y2-y1) = 0.
   *
   * This gives us two equations and two unknowns:
   *
   *   (ry-y1)(x2-x1) = (y2-y1)(rx-x1)
   *   (rx-px)*(x2-x1) + (ry-py)*(y2-y1) = 0.
   *
   * This particular pair of equations is always solvable so long as
   * (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are not the same point (and note that anyone who
   * calls this function that way is braindead because it means that they
   * really didn't specify a line after all).  However, the caller should
   * be careful to avoid making (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) too close (e.g. like
   * 10^{-8} apart in each coordinate), otherwise roundoff error could
   * cause issues.  Solving these equations by hand (or using Maple(TM) or
   * Mathematica(TM) or whatever) results in slightly messy expressions,
   * but that's all the below few lines do.
