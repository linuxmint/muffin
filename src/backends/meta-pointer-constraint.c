 * @title: MetaPointerConstraint
 * @short_description: Pointer client constraints.
 *
 * A MetaPointerConstraint can be used to implement any kind of pointer
 * constraint as requested by a client, such as cursor lock.
 *
 * Examples of pointer constraints are "pointer confinement" and "pointer
 * locking" (as defined in the wayland pointer constraint protocol extension),
 * which restrict movement in relation to a given client.
