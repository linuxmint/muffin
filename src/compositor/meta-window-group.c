 * small, especally since most of our windows are shaped. The simple
 * case we handle here is the case that matters when the user is just
 * using the desktop normally.)
 *
 * If we assume that the window group is untransformed (it better not
 * be!) then we could also make this determination by checking directly
 * if the actor itself is rotated, scaled, or at a non-integral position.
 * However, the criterion for "close enough" in that case get trickier,
 * since, for example, the allowed rotation depends on the size of
 * actor. The approach we take here is to just require everything
