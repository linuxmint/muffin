/**
 * SECTION:MetaTextureTower
 * @short_description: mipmap emulation by creation of scaled down images
 *
 * A #MetaTextureTower is used to get good looking scaled down images when
 * we can't use the GL drivers mipmap support. There are two separate reasons
 *
 *  - Some cards (including radeon cards <= r5xx) only support
 *    TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB and not NPOT textures. Rectangular textures
 *    are defined not to support mipmapping.
 *  - Even when NPOT textures are available, the combination of NPOT
 *    textures, texture_from_pixmap, and mipmapping doesn't typically
 *    work, since the X server doesn't allocate pixmaps in the right
 *    layout for mipmapping.
 *
 * So, what we do is create the "mipmap" levels ourselves by successive
 * power-of-two scaledowns, and when rendering pick the single texture
 * that best matches the scale we are rendering at. (Since we aren't
 * typically using perspective transforms, we'll frequently have a single
 * scale for the entire texture.)
