/* This file uses pixel-aligned region computation to determine what
 * can be clipped out. This only really works if everything is aligned
 * to the pixel grid - not scaled or rotated and at integer offsets.
 *
 * (This could be relaxed - if we turned off filtering for unscaled
 * windows then windows would be, by definition aligned to the pixel
 * grid. And for rectangular windows without a shape, the outline that
 * we draw for an unrotated window is always a rectangle because we
 * don't use antialasing for the window boundary - with or without
 * filtering, with or without a scale. But figuring out exactly
 * what pixels will be drawn by the graphics system in these cases
 * gets tricky, so we just go for the easiest part - no scale,
 * and at integer offsets.)
 *
 * The way we check for pixel-aligned is by looking at the
 * transformation into screen space of the allocation box of an actor
 * and and checking if the corners are "close enough" to integral
 * pixel values.
