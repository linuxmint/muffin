  * meta-window-actor: fix unredirect heuristic Damage coordinates are relative to the drawable not to the screen. So we have to check whether x and y are 0 and not window_rect.x/y otherwise the herustic will never trigger for windows on monitors whos x and y are not 0.
  * meta-window-actor: Consider needs_destroy in is_destroyed() According to the documentation, the method returns "whether the X window that the actor was displaying has been destroyed" - that is very much true when we delay the actual actor destruction for a destroy animation, so update the method accordingly.
  * meta-window-actor: Do not request unredirection when destroyed WindowActors can outlive their corresponding window to animate unmap. Unredirecting the actor does not make sense in that case, so make sure to not request it.

  * Rework the strut handling code to better handle stacked monitor situations
  * keybindings: Currently our move-to-center keybinding respects the current location of the mouse cursor when placing the window. Change the other move-window-to-* keybindings to match this behavior. Also fixes issues with window being placed incorrectly with regards to the panel on multi-monitors with mixed panel layouts.

  * screen.c: Fix toggle-desktop behavior.
  * Fix some warnings
  * compositor.c: handle unstable API break
  * Implement frame sync between apps and compositor.
  * Add meta-sync-ring and nvidia patch -

  [ Dexter Chua ]
  * main.c: remove incorrect comment

  [ JosephMcc ]
  * Keybindings: Change how the "Center window is screen" hotkey works so it centers the window on the proper screen in multiple monitor setups and matches the placement of centered, newly opened windows
  * screen: Add a public meta_screen_get_current_monitor(). A convenience function for getting the current monitor index for the cursor. Helpful when implementing features with proper multiple monitor support.
  * Center attached dialogs on the parent window instead of the parents titlebar.
  * Pull some upstream fixes from mutter to allow getting/setting a windows icon geometry. This will allow us to get a proper working minimize effect when using multiple panel applets
