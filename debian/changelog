  * Remove invalid (transfer) annnotations

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * keybindings: make rebuilding keybindings an idle function.  Prior to this, meta_display_rebuild_keybindings was called around 60 times at startup on my more-or-less stock desktop.  Now it is called approximately once, as an idle function, after all keybinding changes are complete.

  * Rework the strut handling code to better handle stacked monitor situations
  * keybindings: Currently our move-to-center keybinding respects the current location of the mouse cursor when placing the window. Change the other move-window-to-* keybindings to match this behavior. Also fixes issues with window being placed incorrectly with regards to the panel on multi-monitors with mixed panel layouts.

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * screen.c: Fix toggle-desktop behavior.
  * Fix some warnings
  * compositor.c: handle unstable API break
  * Implement frame sync between apps and compositor.
  * Add meta-sync-ring and nvidia patch -

  [ Dexter Chua ]
  * main.c: remove incorrect comment

  [ JosephMcc ]
  * Keybindings: Change how the "Center window is screen" hotkey works so it centers the window on the proper screen in multiple monitor setups and matches the placement of centered, newly opened windows
  * screen: Add a public meta_screen_get_current_monitor(). A convenience function for getting the current monitor index for the cursor. Helpful when implementing features with proper multiple monitor support.
  * Center attached dialogs on the parent window instead of the parents titlebar.
  * Pull some upstream fixes from mutter to allow getting/setting a windows icon geometry. This will allow us to get a proper working minimize effect when using multiple panel applets
