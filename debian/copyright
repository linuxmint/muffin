This package was originally based on the 'mutter' packaging from the Debian
project: <http://packages.qa.debian.org/m/mutter.html>

In turn the mutter package was derived from the metacity package from the
Debian project: <http://packages.qa.debian.org/m/metacity.html>

The metacity package was debianized by Thom May <thom@debian.org> on
Sun, 10 Feb 2002 12:03:22 +0000.
