/**
 * SECTION:clutter-effect
 * @short_description: Base class for actor effects
 *
 * The #ClutterEffect class provides a default type and API for creating
 * effects for generic actors.
 *
 * Effects are a #ClutterActorMeta sub-class that modify the way an actor
 * is painted in a way that is not part of the actor's implementation.
 *
 * Effects should be the preferred way to affect the paint sequence of an
 * actor without sub-classing the actor itself and overriding the
 * #ClutterActorClass.paint()_ virtual function.
 *
 * ## Implementing a ClutterEffect
 *
 * Creating a sub-class of #ClutterEffect requires overriding the
 * #ClutterEffectClass.paint() method. The implementation of the function should look
 * something like this:
 *
 * |[
 * void effect_paint (ClutterEffect *effect, ClutterEffectPaintFlags flags)
 * {
 *   // Set up initialisation of the paint such as binding a
 *   // CoglOffscreen or other operations
 *
 *   // Chain to the next item in the paint sequence. This will either call
 *   // ‘paint’ on the next effect or just paint the actor if this is
 *   // the last effect.
 *   ClutterActor *actor =
 *     clutter_actor_meta_get_actor (CLUTTER_ACTOR_META (effect));
 *
 *   clutter_actor_continue_paint (actor);
 *
 *   // perform any cleanup of state, such as popping the CoglOffscreen
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * The effect can optionally avoid calling clutter_actor_continue_paint() to skip any
 * further stages of the paint sequence. This is useful for example if the effect
 * contains a cached image of the actor. In that case it can optimise painting by
 * avoiding the actor paint and instead painting the cached image.
 *
 * The %CLUTTER_EFFECT_PAINT_ACTOR_DIRTY flag is useful in this case. Clutter will set
 * this flag when a redraw has been queued on the actor since it was last painted. The
 * effect can use this information to decide if the cached image is still valid.
 *
 * ## A simple ClutterEffect implementation
 *
 * The example below creates two rectangles: one will be painted "behind" the actor,
 * while another will be painted "on top" of the actor.
 *
 * The #ClutterActorMetaClass.set_actor() implementation will create the two materials
 * used for the two different rectangles; the #ClutterEffectClass.paint() implementation
 * will paint the first material using cogl_rectangle(), before continuing and then it
 * will paint paint the second material after.
 *

 *    ClutterEffect parent_instance;

/**
 * clutter_effect_queue_repaint:
 * @effect: A #ClutterEffect which needs redrawing
 *
 * Queues a repaint of the effect. The effect can detect when the ‘paint’
 * method is called as a result of this function because it will not
 * have the %CLUTTER_EFFECT_PAINT_ACTOR_DIRTY flag set. In that case the
 * effect is free to assume that the actor has not changed its
 * appearance since the last time it was painted so it doesn't need to
 * call clutter_actor_continue_paint() if it can draw a cached
 * image. This is mostly intended for effects that are using a
 * %CoglOffscreen to redirect the actor (such as
 * %ClutterOffscreenEffect). In that case the effect can save a bit of
 * rendering time by painting the cached texture without causing the
 * entire actor to be painted.
 *
 * This function can be used by effects that have their own animatable
 * parameters. For example, an effect which adds a varying degree of a
 * red tint to an actor by redirecting it through a CoglOffscreen
 * might have a property to specify the level of tint. When this value
 * changes, the underlying actor doesn't need to be redrawn so the
 * effect can call clutter_effect_queue_repaint() to make sure the
 * effect is repainted.
 *
 * Note however that modifying the position of the parent of an actor
 * may change the appearance of the actor because its transformation
 * matrix would change. In this case a redraw wouldn't be queued on
 * the actor itself so the %CLUTTER_EFFECT_PAINT_ACTOR_DIRTY would still
 * not be set. The effect can detect this case by keeping track of the
 * last modelview matrix that was used to render the actor and
 * veryifying that it remains the same in the next paint.
 *
 * Any other effects that are layered on top of the passed in effect
 * will still be passed the %CLUTTER_EFFECT_PAINT_ACTOR_DIRTY flag. If
 * anything queues a redraw on the actor without specifying an effect
 * or with an effect that is lower in the chain of effects than this
 * one then that will override this call. In that case this effect
 * will instead be called with the %CLUTTER_EFFECT_PAINT_ACTOR_DIRTY
 * flag set.
 *
 * Since: 1.8
