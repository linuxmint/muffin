/**
 * SECTION:clutter-drop-action
 * @Title: ClutterDropAction
 * @short_description: An action for drop targets
 *
 * #ClutterDropAction is a #ClutterAction that allows a #ClutterActor
 * implementation to control what happens when an actor dragged using
 * a #ClutterDragAction crosses the target area or when a dragged actor
 * is released (or "dropped") on the target area.
 *
 * A trivial use of #ClutterDropAction consists in connecting to the
 * #ClutterDropAction::drop signal and handling the drop from there,
 * for instance:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   ClutterAction *action = clutter_drop_action ();
 *
 *   g_signal_connect (action, "drop", G_CALLBACK (on_drop), NULL);
 *   clutter_actor_add_action (an_actor, action);
 * ]|
 *
 * The #ClutterDropAction::can-drop can be used to control whether the
 * #ClutterDropAction::drop signal is going to be emitted; returning %FALSE
 * from a handler connected to the #ClutterDropAction::can-drop signal will
 * cause the #ClutterDropAction::drop signal to be skipped when the input
 * device button is released.
 *
 * It's important to note that #ClutterDropAction will only work with
 * actors dragged using #ClutterDragAction.
 *
 * See [drop-action.c](https://git.gnome.org/browse/clutter/tree/examples/drop-action.c?h=clutter-1.18)
 * for an example of how to use #ClutterDropAction.
 *
 * #ClutterDropAction is available since Clutter 1.8
