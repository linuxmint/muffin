/**
 * SECTION:clutter-actor
 * @short_description: The basic element of the scene graph
 *
 * The ClutterActor class is the basic element of the scene graph in Clutter,
 * and it encapsulates the position, size, and transformations of a node in
 * the graph.
 *
 * ## Actor transformations ## {#clutter-actor-transformations}
 *
 * Each actor can be transformed using methods like clutter_actor_set_scale()
 * or clutter_actor_set_rotation(). The order in which the transformations are
 * applied is decided by Clutter and it is the following:
 *
 *  1. translation by the origin of the #ClutterActor:allocation property
 *  2. translation by the actor's #ClutterActor:z-position property
 *  3. translation by the actor's #ClutterActor:pivot-point property
 *  4. scaling by the #ClutterActor:scale-x and #ClutterActor:scale-y factors
 *  5. rotation around the #ClutterActor:rotation-angle-x and #ClutterActor:rotation-center-x
 *  6. rotation around the #ClutterActor:rotation-angle-y and #ClutterActor:rotation-center-y
 *  7. rotation around the #ClutterActor:rotation-angle-z and #ClutterActor:rotation-center-z
 *  8. negative translation by the #ClutterActor:anchor-x and #ClutterActor:anchor-y point.
 *  9. negative translation by the actor's #ClutterActor:pivot-point
 *
 * ## Modifying an actor's geometry ## {#clutter-actor-geometry}
 *
 * Each actor has a bounding box, called #ClutterActor:allocation
 * which is either set by its parent or explicitly through the
 * clutter_actor_set_position() and clutter_actor_set_size() methods.
 * Each actor also has an implicit preferred size.
 *
 * An actor’s preferred size can be defined by any subclass by
 * overriding the #ClutterActorClass.get_preferred_width() and the
 * #ClutterActorClass.get_preferred_height() virtual functions, or it can
 * be explicitly set by using clutter_actor_set_width() and
 * clutter_actor_set_height().
 *
 * An actor’s position can be set explicitly by using
 * clutter_actor_set_x() and clutter_actor_set_y(); the coordinates are
 * relative to the origin of the actor’s parent.
 *
 * ## Managing actor children ## {#clutter-actor-children}
 *
 * Each actor can have multiple children, by calling
 * clutter_actor_add_child() to add a new child actor, and
 * clutter_actor_remove_child() to remove an existing child. #ClutterActor
 * will hold a reference on each child actor, which will be released when
 * the child is removed from its parent, or destroyed using
 * clutter_actor_destroy().
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *  ClutterActor *actor = clutter_actor_new ();
 *
 *  // set the bounding box of the actor
 *  clutter_actor_set_position (actor, 0, 0);
 *  clutter_actor_set_size (actor, 480, 640);
 *
 *  // set the background color of the actor
 *  clutter_actor_set_background_color (actor, CLUTTER_COLOR_Orange);
 *
 *  // set the bounding box of the child, relative to the parent
 *  ClutterActor *child = clutter_actor_new ();
 *  clutter_actor_set_position (child, 20, 20);
 *  clutter_actor_set_size (child, 80, 240);
 *
 *  // set the background color of the child
 *  clutter_actor_set_background_color (child, CLUTTER_COLOR_Blue);
 *
 *  // add the child to the actor
 *  clutter_actor_add_child (actor, child);
 * ]|
 *
 * Children can be inserted at a given index, or above and below
 * another child actor. The order of insertion determines the order of the
 * children when iterating over them. Iterating over children is performed
 * by using clutter_actor_get_first_child(), clutter_actor_get_previous_sibling(),
 * clutter_actor_get_next_sibling(), and clutter_actor_get_last_child(). It is
 * also possible to retrieve a list of children by using
 * clutter_actor_get_children(), as well as retrieving a specific child at a
 * given index by using clutter_actor_get_child_at_index().
 *
 * If you need to track additions of children to a #ClutterActor, use
 * the #ClutterContainer::actor-added signal; similarly, to track removals
 * of children from a ClutterActor, use the #ClutterContainer::actor-removed
 * signal.
 *
 * See [basic-actor.c](https://git.gnome.org/browse/clutter/tree/examples/basic-actor.c?h=clutter-1.18).
 *
 * ## Painting an actor ## {#clutter-actor-painting}
 *
 * There are three ways to paint an actor:
 *
 *  - set a delegate #ClutterContent as the value for the #ClutterActor:content property of the actor
 *  - subclass #ClutterActor and override the #ClutterActorClass.paint_node() virtual function
 *  - subclass #ClutterActor and override the #ClutterActorClass.paint() virtual function.
 *
 * A #ClutterContent is a delegate object that takes over the painting
 * operations of one, or more actors. The #ClutterContent painting will
 * be performed on top of the #ClutterActor:background-color of the actor,
 * and before calling the actor's own implementation of the
 * #ClutterActorClass.paint_node() virtual function.
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * ClutterActor *actor = clutter_actor_new ();
 *
 * // set the bounding box
 * clutter_actor_set_position (actor, 50, 50);
 * clutter_actor_set_size (actor, 100, 100);
 *
 * // set the content; the image_content variable is set elsewhere
 * clutter_actor_set_content (actor, image_content);
 * ]|
 *
 * The #ClutterActorClass.paint_node() virtual function is invoked whenever
 * an actor needs to be painted. The implementation of the virtual function
 * must only paint the contents of the actor itself, and not the contents of
 * its children, if the actor has any.
 *
 * The #ClutterPaintNode passed to the virtual function is the local root of
 * the render tree; any node added to it will be rendered at the correct
 * position, as defined by the actor's #ClutterActor:allocation.
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * static void
 * my_actor_paint_node (ClutterActor     *actor,
 *                      ClutterPaintNode *root)
 * {
 *   ClutterPaintNode *node;
 *   ClutterActorBox box;
 *
 *   // where the content of the actor should be painted
 *   clutter_actor_get_allocation_box (actor, &box);
 *
 *   // the cogl_texture variable is set elsewhere
 *   node = clutter_texture_node_new (cogl_texture, CLUTTER_COLOR_White,
 *                                    CLUTTER_SCALING_FILTER_TRILINEAR,
 *                                    CLUTTER_SCALING_FILTER_LINEAR);
 *
 *   // paint the content of the node using the allocation
 *   clutter_paint_node_add_rectangle (node, &box);
 *
 *   // add the node, and transfer ownership
 *   clutter_paint_node_add_child (root, node);
 *   clutter_paint_node_unref (node);
 * }
 *
 * The #ClutterActorClass.paint() virtual function is invoked when the
 * #ClutterActor::paint signal is emitted, and after the other signal
 * handlers have been invoked. Overriding the paint virtual function
 * gives total control to the paint sequence of the actor itself,
 * including the children of the actor, if any.
 *
 * It is strongly discouraged to override the #ClutterActorClass.paint()
 * virtual function, as well as connecting to the #ClutterActor::paint
 * signal. These hooks into the paint sequence are considered legacy, and
 * will be removed when the Clutter API changes.
 *
 * ## Handling events on an actor ## {#clutter-actor-event-handling}
 *
 * A #ClutterActor can receive and handle input device events, for
 * instance pointer events and key events, as long as its
 * #ClutterActor:reactive property is set to %TRUE.
 *
 * Once an actor has been determined to be the source of an event,
 * Clutter will traverse the scene graph from the top-level actor towards the
 * event source, emitting the #ClutterActor::captured-event signal on each
 * ancestor until it reaches the source; this phase is also called
 * the "capture" phase. If the event propagation was not stopped, the graph
 * is walked backwards, from the source actor to the top-level, and the
 * #ClutterActor::event signal is emitted, alongside eventual event-specific
 * signals like #ClutterActor::button-press-event or #ClutterActor::motion-event;
 * this phase is also called the "bubble" phase.
 *
 * At any point of the signal emission, signal handlers can stop the propagation
 * through the scene graph by returning %CLUTTER_EVENT_STOP; otherwise, they can
 * continue the propagation by returning %CLUTTER_EVENT_PROPAGATE.
 *
 * ## Animation ## {#clutter-actor-animation}
 *
 * Animation is a core concept of modern user interfaces; Clutter provides a
 * complete and powerful animation framework that automatically tweens the
 * actor's state without requiring direct, frame by frame manipulation from
 * your application code. You have two models at your disposal:
 *
 *  - an implicit animation model
 *  - an explicit animation model
 *
 * The implicit animation model of Clutter assumes that all the
 * changes in an actor state should be gradual and asynchronous; Clutter
 * will automatically transition an actor's property change between the
 * current state and the desired one without manual intervention, if the
 * property is defined to be animatable in its documentation.
 *
 * By default, in the 1.0 API series, the transition happens with a duration
 * of zero milliseconds, and the implicit animation is an opt in feature to
 * retain backwards compatibility.
 *
 * Implicit animations depend on the current easing state; in order to use
 * the default easing state for an actor you should call the
 * clutter_actor_save_easing_state() function:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * // assume that the actor is currently positioned at (100, 100)
 *
 * // store the current easing state and reset the new easing state to
 * // its default values
 * clutter_actor_save_easing_state (actor);
 *
 * // change the actor's position
 * clutter_actor_set_position (actor, 500, 500);
 *
 * // restore the previously saved easing state
 * clutter_actor_restore_easing_state (actor);
 * ]|
 *
 * The example above will trigger an implicit animation of the
 * actor between its current position to a new position.
 *
 * Implicit animations use a default duration of 250 milliseconds,
 * and a default easing mode of %CLUTTER_EASE_OUT_CUBIC, unless you call
 * clutter_actor_set_easing_mode() and clutter_actor_set_easing_duration()
 * after changing the easing state of the actor.
 *
 * It is possible to animate multiple properties of an actor
 * at the same time, and you can animate multiple actors at the same
 * time as well, for instance:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * clutter_actor_save_easing_state (actor);
 *
 * // animate the actor's opacity and depth
 * clutter_actor_set_opacity (actor, 0);
 * clutter_actor_set_depth (actor, -100);
 *
 * clutter_actor_restore_easing_state (actor);
 *
 * clutter_actor_save_easing_state (another_actor);
 *
 * // animate another actor's opacity
 * clutter_actor_set_opacity (another_actor, 255);
 * clutter_actor_set_depth (another_actor, 100);
 *
 * clutter_actor_restore_easing_state (another_actor);
 * ]|
 *
 * Changing the easing state will affect all the following property
 * transitions, but will not affect existing transitions.
 *
 * It is important to note that if you modify the state on an
 * animatable property while a transition is in flight, the transition's
 * final value will be updated, as well as its duration and progress
 * mode by using the current easing state; for instance, in the following
 * example:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * clutter_actor_save_easing_state (actor);
 * clutter_actor_set_easing_duration (actor, 1000);
 * clutter_actor_set_x (actor, 200);
 * clutter_actor_restore_easing_state (actor);
 *
 * clutter_actor_save_easing_state (actor);
 * clutter_actor_set_easing_duration (actor, 500);
 * clutter_actor_set_x (actor, 100);
 * clutter_actor_restore_easing_state (actor);
 * ]|
 *
 * the first call to clutter_actor_set_x() will begin a transition
 * of the #ClutterActor:x property from the current value to the value of
 * 200 over a duration of one second; the second call to clutter_actor_set_x()
 * will change the transition's final value to 100 and the duration to 500
 * milliseconds.
 *
 * It is possible to receive a notification of the completion of an
 * implicit transition by using the #ClutterActor::transition-stopped
 * signal, decorated with the name of the property. In case you want to
 * know when all the currently in flight transitions are complete, use
 * the #ClutterActor::transitions-completed signal instead.
 *
 * It is possible to retrieve the #ClutterTransition used by the
 * animatable properties by using clutter_actor_get_transition() and using
 * the property name as the transition name.
 *
 * The explicit animation model supported by Clutter requires that
 * you create a #ClutterTransition object, and optionally set the initial
 * and final values. The transition will not start unless you add it to the
 * #ClutterActor.
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * ClutterTransition *transition;
 *
 * transition = clutter_property_transition_new ("opacity");
 * clutter_timeline_set_duration (CLUTTER_TIMELINE (transition), 3000);
 * clutter_timeline_set_repeat_count (CLUTTER_TIMELINE (transition), 2);
 * clutter_timeline_set_auto_reverse (CLUTTER_TIMELINE (transition), TRUE);
 * clutter_transition_set_from (transition, G_TYPE_UINT, 255);
 * clutter_transition_set_to (transition, G_TYPE_UINT, 0);
 *
 * clutter_actor_add_transition (actor, "animate-opacity", transition);
 * ]|
 *
 * The example above will animate the #ClutterActor:opacity property
 * of an actor between fully opaque and fully transparent, and back, over
 * a span of 3 seconds. The animation does not begin until it is added to
 * the actor.
 *
 * The explicit animation API applies to all #GObject properties,
 * as well as the custom properties defined through the #ClutterAnimatable
 * interface, regardless of whether they are defined as implicitly
 * animatable or not.
 *
 * The explicit animation API should also be used when using custom
 * animatable properties for #ClutterAction, #ClutterConstraint, and
 * #ClutterEffect instances associated to an actor; see the section on
 * custom animatable properties below for an example.
 *
 * Finally, explicit animations are useful for creating animations
 * that run continuously, for instance:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * // this animation will pulse the actor's opacity continuously
 * ClutterTransition *transition;
 * ClutterInterval *interval;
 *
 * transition = clutter_property_transition_new ("opacity");
 *
 * // we want to animate the opacity between 0 and 255
 * clutter_transition_set_from (transition, G_TYPE_UINT, 0);
 * clutter_transition_set_to (transition, G_TYPE_UINT, 255);
 *
 * // over a one second duration, running an infinite amount of times
 * clutter_timeline_set_duration (CLUTTER_TIMELINE (transition), 1000);
 * clutter_timeline_set_repeat_count (CLUTTER_TIMELINE (transition), -1);
 *
 * // we want to fade in and out, so we need to auto-reverse the transition
 * clutter_timeline_set_auto_reverse (CLUTTER_TIMELINE (transition), TRUE);
 *
 * // and we want to use an easing function that eases both in and out
 * clutter_timeline_set_progress_mode (CLUTTER_TIMELINE (transition),
 *                                     CLUTTER_EASE_IN_OUT_CUBIC);
 *
 * // add the transition to the desired actor to start it
 * clutter_actor_add_transition (actor, "opacityAnimation", transition);
 * ]|
 *
 * ## Implementing an actor ## {#clutter-actor-implementing}
 *
 * Careful consideration should be given when deciding to implement
 * a #ClutterActor sub-class. It is generally recommended to implement a
 * sub-class of #ClutterActor only for actors that should be used as leaf
 * nodes of a scene graph.
 *
 * If your actor should be painted in a custom way, you should
 * override the #ClutterActor::paint signal class handler. You can either
 * opt to chain up to the parent class implementation or decide to fully
 * override the default paint implementation; Clutter will set up the
 * transformations and clip regions prior to emitting the #ClutterActor::paint
 * signal.
 *
 * By overriding the #ClutterActorClass.get_preferred_width() and
 * #ClutterActorClass.get_preferred_height() virtual functions it is
 * possible to change or provide the preferred size of an actor; similarly,
 * by overriding the #ClutterActorClass.allocate() virtual function it is
 * possible to control the layout of the children of an actor. Make sure to
 * always chain up to the parent implementation of the
 * #ClutterActorClass.allocate() virtual function.
 *
 * In general, it is strongly encouraged to use delegation and composition
 * instead of direct subclassing.
 *
 * ## ClutterActor custom properties for ClutterScript ## {#clutter-actor-custom-script}
 *
 * #ClutterActor defines a custom "rotation" property which allows a short-hand
 * description of the rotations to be applied to an actor.
 *
 * The syntax of the "rotation" property is the following:
 *
 * |[
 * "rotation" : [ { "<axis>" : [ <angle>, [ <center-point> ] ] } ]
 * ]|
 *
 * where:
 *
 *  - axis is the name of an enumeration value of type #ClutterRotateAxis
 *  - angle is a floating point value representing the rotation angle on the given axis in degrees
 *  - center-point is an optional array, and if present it must contain the center of rotation as described by two coordinates:
 *    - Y and Z for "x-axis"
 *    - X and Z for "y-axis"
 *    - X and Y for "z-axis".
 *
 * #ClutterActor also defines a scriptable "margin" property which follows the CSS "margin" shorthand.
 *
 * |[
 *   // 4 values
 *   "margin" : [ top, right, bottom, left ]
 *   // 3 values
 *   "margin" : [ top, left/right, bottom ]
 *   // 2 values
 *   "margin" : [ top/bottom, left/right ]
 *   // 1 value
 *   "margin" : [ top/right/bottom/left ]
 * ]|
 *
 * #ClutterActor will also parse every positional and dimensional
 * property defined as a string through clutter_units_from_string(); you
 * should read the documentation for the #ClutterUnits parser format for
 * the valid units and syntax.
 *
 * ## Custom animatable properties
 *
 * #ClutterActor allows accessing properties of #ClutterAction,
 * #ClutterEffect, and #ClutterConstraint instances associated to an actor
 * instance for animation purposes.
 *
 * In order to access a specific #ClutterAction or a #ClutterConstraint
 * property it is necessary to set the #ClutterActorMeta:name property on the
 * given action or constraint.
 *
 * The property can be accessed using the following syntax:
 *
 * |[
 *   @<section>.<meta-name>.<property-name>
 * ]|
 *
 *  - the initial `@` is mandatory
 *  - the `section` fragment can be one between "actions", "constraints" and "effects"
 *  - the `meta-name` fragment is the name of the action, effect, or constraint, as
 *    specified by the #ClutterActorMeta:name property of #ClutterActorMeta
 *  - the `property-name` fragment is the name of the action, effect, or constraint
 *    property to be animated.
 *
 * The example below animates a #ClutterBindConstraint applied to an actor
 * using an explicit transition. The `rect` actor has a binding constraint
 * on the `origin` actor, and in its initial state is overlapping the actor
 * to which is bound to.
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * constraint = clutter_bind_constraint_new (origin, CLUTTER_BIND_X, 0.0);
 * clutter_actor_meta_set_name (CLUTTER_ACTOR_META (constraint), "bind-x");
 * clutter_actor_add_constraint (rect, constraint);
 *
 * constraint = clutter_bind_constraint_new (origin, CLUTTER_BIND_Y, 0.0);
 * clutter_actor_meta_set_name (CLUTTER_ACTOR_META (constraint), "bind-y");
 * clutter_actor_add_constraint (rect, constraint);
 *
 * clutter_actor_set_reactive (origin, TRUE);
 *
 * g_signal_connect (origin, "button-press-event",
 *                   G_CALLBACK (on_button_press),
 *                   rect);
 * ]|
 *
 * On button press, the rectangle "slides" from behind the actor to
 * which is bound to, using the #ClutterBindConstraint:offset property to
 * achieve the effect:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * gboolean
 * on_button_press (ClutterActor *origin,
 *                  ClutterEvent *event,
 *                  ClutterActor *rect)
 * {
 *   ClutterTransition *transition;
 *
 *   // the offset that we want to apply; this will make the actor
 *   // slide in from behind the origin and rest at the right of
 *   // the origin, plus a padding value
 *   float new_offset = clutter_actor_get_width (origin) + h_padding;
 *
 *   // the property we wish to animate; the "@constraints" section
 *   // tells Clutter to check inside the constraints associated
 *   // with the actor; the "bind-x" section is the name of the
 *   // constraint; and the "offset" is the name of the property
 *   // on the constraint
 *   const char *prop = "@constraints.bind-x.offset";
 *
 *   // create a new transition for the given property
 *   transition = clutter_property_transition_new (prop);
 *
 *   // set the easing mode and duration
 *   clutter_timeline_set_progress_mode (CLUTTER_TIMELINE (transition),
 *                                       CLUTTER_EASE_OUT_CUBIC);
 *   clutter_timeline_set_duration (CLUTTER_TIMELINE (transition), 500);
 *
 *   // create the interval with the initial and final values
 *   clutter_transition_set_from (transition, G_TYPE_FLOAT, 0.f);
 *   clutter_transition_set_to (transition, G_TYPE_FLOAT, new_offset);
 *
 *   // add the transition to the actor; this causes the animation
 *   // to start. the name "offsetAnimation" can be used to retrieve
 *   // the transition later
 *   clutter_actor_add_transition (rect, "offsetAnimation", transition);
 *
 *   // we handled the event
 *   return CLUTTER_EVENT_STOP;
 * }
 * ]|

   * created using "g_object_new (CLUTTER_TYPE_ACTOR, NULL)".
   *
   * we also want any subclass of ClutterActor that does not override the
   * ::allocate() virtual function to delegate to a layout manager.
   *
   * finally, we want to allow people subclassing ClutterActor and overriding
   * the ::allocate() vfunc to let Clutter delegate to the layout manager.
   *
   * on the other hand, we want existing actor subclasses overriding the
   * ::allocate() virtual function and chaining up to the parent's
   * implementation to continue working without allocating their children
   * twice, or without entering an allocation loop.
   *
   * for the first two points, we check if the class of the actor is
   * overridding the ::allocate() virtual function; if it isn't, then we
   * follow through with checking whether we have children and a layout
   * manager, and eventually calling clutter_layout_manager_allocate().
   *
   * for the third point, we check the CLUTTER_DELEGATE_LAYOUT flag in the
   * allocation flags that we got passed, and if it is present, we continue
   * with the check above.

 *
 * For example if you need a matrix that can transform the local actor

 * If you pass %NULL then the transformation will take you all the way through

 * modelview transform that Clutter applies before applying the projection
 * transformation. If you want to explicitly set a modelview on a CoglFramebuffer
 * using cogl_set_modelview_matrix() for example then you would want a matrix
 * that transforms into eye coordinates.
 *
 * This function doesn't initialize the given @matrix, it simply
 * multiplies the requested transformation matrix with the existing contents of

  /* Here's an outline of the actor queue redraw mechanism:
   *
   * The process starts in one of the following two functions which
   * are wrappers for this function:
   *
   *   clutter_actor_queue_redraw()
   *   _clutter_actor_queue_redraw_with_clip()
   *
   * additionally, an effect can queue a redraw by wrapping this
   * function in clutter_effect_queue_repaint().
   *
   * This functions queues an entry in a list associated with the
   * stage which is a list of actors that queued a redraw while
   * updating the timelines, performing layouting and processing other
   * mainloop sources before the next paint starts.
   *
   * We aim to minimize the processing done at this point because
   * there is a good chance other events will happen while updating
   * the scenegraph that would invalidate any expensive work we might
   * otherwise try to do here. For example we don't try and resolve
   * the screen space bounding box of an actor at this stage so as to
   * minimize how much of the screen redraw because it's possible
   * something else will happen which will force a full redraw anyway.
   *
   * When all updates are complete and we come to paint the stage then
   * we iterate this list and actually emit the "queue-redraw" signals
   * for each of the listed actors which will bubble up to the stage
   * for each actor and at that point we will transform the actors
   * paint volume into screen coordinates to determine the clip region
   * for what needs to be redrawn in the next paint.
   *
   * Besides minimizing redundant work another reason for this
   * deferred design is that it's more likely we will be able to
   * determine the paint volume of an actor once we've finished
   * updating the scenegraph because its allocation should be up to
   * date. NB: If we can't determine an actors paint volume then we
   * can't automatically queue a clipped redraw which can make a big
   * difference to performance.
   *
   * So the control flow goes like this:
   * One of clutter_actor_queue_redraw(),
   *        _clutter_actor_queue_redraw_with_clip(),
   *     or clutter_effect_queue_repaint()
   *
   * then control moves to:
   *   _clutter_stage_queue_actor_redraw()
   *
   * later during _clutter_stage_do_update(), once relayouting is done
   * and the scenegraph has been updated we will call:
   * _clutter_stage_finish_queue_redraws().
   *
   * _clutter_stage_finish_queue_redraws() will call
   * _clutter_actor_finish_queue_redraw() for each listed actor.
   *
   * Note: actors *are* allowed to queue further redraws during this
   * process (considering clone actors or texture_new_from_actor which
   * respond to their source queueing a redraw by queuing a redraw
   * themselves). We repeat the process until the list is empty.
   *
   * This will result in the "queue-redraw" signal being fired for
   * each actor which will pass control to the default signal handler:
   * clutter_actor_real_queue_redraw()
   *
   * This will bubble up to the stages handler:
   * clutter_stage_real_queue_redraw()
   *
   * clutter_stage_real_queue_redraw() will transform the actors paint
   * volume into screen space and add it as a clip region for the next
   * paint.

/**
 * clutter_actor_set_allocation:
 * @self: a #ClutterActor

 * @flags: allocation flags
 *
 * Stores the allocation of @self as defined by @box.
 *
 * This function can only be called from within the implementation of
 * the #ClutterActorClass.allocate() virtual function.
 *
 * The allocation should have been adjusted to take into account constraints,
 * alignment, and margin properties. If you are implementing a #ClutterActor
 * subclass that provides its own layout management policy for its children
 * instead of using a #ClutterLayoutManager delegate, you should not call
 * this function on the children of @self; instead, you should call
 * clutter_actor_allocate(), which will adjust the allocation box for
 * you.
 *
 * This function should only be used by subclasses of #ClutterActor
 * that wish to store their allocation but cannot chain up to the
 * parent's implementation; the default implementation of the
 * #ClutterActorClass.allocate() virtual function will call this
 * function.
 *
 * It is important to note that, while chaining up was the recommended
 * behaviour for #ClutterActor subclasses prior to the introduction of
 * this function, it is recommended to call clutter_actor_set_allocation()
 * instead.
 *
 * If the #ClutterActor is using a #ClutterLayoutManager delegate object
 * to handle the allocation of its children, this function will call
 * the clutter_layout_manager_allocate() function only if the
 * %CLUTTER_DELEGATE_LAYOUT flag is set on @flags, otherwise it is
 * expected that the subclass will call clutter_layout_manager_allocate()
 * by itself. For instance, the following code:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * static void
 * my_actor_allocate (ClutterActor *actor,
 *                    const ClutterActorBox *allocation,

 * {
 *   ClutterActorBox new_alloc;

 *
 *   adjust_allocation (allocation, &new_alloc);
 *
 *   new_flags = flags | CLUTTER_DELEGATE_LAYOUT;
 *
 *   // this will use the layout manager set on the actor
 *   clutter_actor_set_allocation (actor, &new_alloc, new_flags);
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * is equivalent to this:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * static void
 * my_actor_allocate (ClutterActor *actor,
 *                    const ClutterActorBox *allocation,

 * clutter_actor_set_offscreen_redirect:
 * @self: A #ClutterActor
 * @redirect: New offscreen redirect flags for the actor.
 *
 * Defines the circumstances where the actor should be redirected into
 * an offscreen image. The offscreen image is used to flatten the
 * actor into a single image while painting for two main reasons.
 * Firstly, when the actor is painted a second time without any of its
 * contents changing it can simply repaint the cached image without
 * descending further down the actor hierarchy. Secondly, it will make
 * the opacity look correct even if there are overlapping primitives
 * in the actor.
 *
 * Caching the actor could in some cases be a performance win and in
 * some cases be a performance lose so it is important to determine
 * which value is right for an actor before modifying this value. For
 * example, there is never any reason to flatten an actor that is just
 * a single texture (such as a #ClutterTexture) because it is
 * effectively already cached in an image so the offscreen would be
 * redundant. Also if the actor contains primitives that are far apart
 * with a large transparent area in the middle (such as a large
 * CluterGroup with a small actor in the top left and a small actor in
 * the bottom right) then the cached image will contain the entire
 * image of the large area and the paint will waste time blending all
 * of the transparent pixels in the middle.
 *
 * The default method of implementing opacity on a container simply
 * forwards on the opacity to all of the children. If the children are
 * overlapping then it will appear as if they are two separate glassy
 * objects and there will be a break in the color where they
 * overlap. By redirecting to an offscreen buffer it will be as if the
 * two opaque objects are combined into one and then made transparent
 * which is usually what is expected.
 *
 * The image below demonstrates the difference between redirecting and
 * not. The image shows two Clutter groups, each containing a red and
 * a green rectangle which overlap. The opacity on the group is set to
 * 128 (which is 50%). When the offscreen redirect is not used, the
 * red rectangle can be seen through the blue rectangle as if the two
 * rectangles were separately transparent. When the redirect is used
 * the group as a whole is transparent instead so the red rectangle is
 * not visible where they overlap.
 *
 * <figure id="offscreen-redirect">
 *   <title>Sample of using an offscreen redirect for transparency</title>
 *   <graphic fileref="offscreen-redirect.png" format="PNG"/>
 * </figure>
 *
 * The default value for this property is 0, so we effectively will
 * never redirect an actor offscreen by default. This means that there
 * are times that transparent actors may look glassy as described
 * above. The reason this is the default is because there is a
 * performance trade off between quality and performance here. In many
 * cases the default form of glassy opacity looks good enough, but if
 * it's not you will need to set the
 * %CLUTTER_OFFSCREEN_REDIRECT_AUTOMATIC_FOR_OPACITY flag to enable
 * redirection for opacity.
 *
 * Custom actors that don't contain any overlapping primitives are
 * recommended to override the has_overlaps() virtual to return %FALSE
 * for maximum efficiency.

   *
   * the reproducible sequence is:
   *
   *   - actor gets destroyed;
   *   - another actor, linked to the first, will try to change the
   *     stacking order of the first actor;
   *   - changing the stacking order is a composite operation composed
   *     by the following steps:
   *     1. ref() the child;
   *     2. remove_child_internal(), which removes the reference;
   *     3. add_child_internal(), which adds a reference;
   *   - the state of the actor is not changed between (2) and (3), as
   *     it could be an expensive recomputation;
   *   - if (3) bails out, then the actor is in an undefined state, but
   *     still alive;
   *   - the destruction sequence terminates, but the actor is unparented
   *     while its state indicates being parented instead.
   *   - assertion failure.
   *
   * the obvious fix would be to decompose each set_child_*_sibling()
   * method into proper remove_child()/add_child(), with state validation;
   * this may cause excessive work, though, and trigger a cascade of other
   * bugs in code that assumes that a change in the stacking order is an
   * atomic operation.
   *
   * another potential fix is to just remove this check here, and let
   * code doing stacking order changes inside the destruction sequence
   * of an actor continue doing the stacking changes as before; this
   * option still performs more work than necessary.
   *
   * the third fix is to silently bail out early from every
   * set_child_*_sibling() and set_child_at_index() method, and avoid
   * doing stack changes altogether; Clutter implements this last option.
   *

   *   paint-volume.

 *
 * The paint volume is defined as the 3D space occupied by an actor
 * when being painted.
 *
 * This function will call the #ClutterActorClass.get_paint_volume()
 * virtual function of the #ClutterActor class. Sub-classes of #ClutterActor
 * should not usually care about overriding the default implementation,
 * unless they are, for instance: painting outside their allocation, or
 * actors with a depth factor (not in terms of #ClutterActor:depth but real
 * 3D depth).
 *
 * Note: 2D actors overriding #ClutterActorClass.get_paint_volume()
 * should ensure that their volume has a depth of 0. (This will be true
 * as long as you don't call clutter_paint_volume_set_depth().)
 *
 * Return value: (transfer none): a pointer to a #ClutterPaintVolume,
