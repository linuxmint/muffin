/**
 * SECTION:clutter-tap-action
 * @Title: ClutterTapAction
 * @Short_Description: Action for tap gestures
 *
 * #ClutterTapAction is a sub-class of #ClutterGestureAction that implements
 * the logic for recognizing mouse clicks and touch tap gestures.
 *
 * The simplest usage of #ClutterTapAction consists in adding it to
 * a #ClutterActor, setting it as reactive and connecting a
 * callback for the #ClutterTapAction::tap signal, along the lines of the
 * following code:
 *
 * |[
 *   clutter_actor_add_action (actor, clutter_tap_action_new ());
 *   clutter_actor_set_reactive (actor, TRUE);
 *   g_signal_connect (action, "tap", G_CALLBACK (on_tap_callback), NULL);
 * ]|
 *
 * Since: 1.14
