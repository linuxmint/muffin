/**
 * SECTION:clutter-clone
 * @short_description: An actor that displays a clone of a source actor
 *
 * #ClutterClone is a #ClutterActor which draws with the paint
 * function of another actor, scaled to fit its own allocation.
 *
 * #ClutterClone can be used to efficiently clone any other actor.
 *
 * Unlike clutter_texture_new_from_actor(), #ClutterClone does not require
 * the presence of support for FBOs in the underlying GL or GLES
 * implementation.
 *
 * #ClutterClone is available since Clutter 1.0
