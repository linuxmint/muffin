/**
 * SECTION:clutter-offscreen-effect
 * @short_description: Base class for effects using offscreen buffers
 * @see_also: #ClutterBlurEffect, #ClutterEffect
 *
 * #ClutterOffscreenEffect is an abstract class that can be used by
 * #ClutterEffect sub-classes requiring access to an offscreen buffer.
 *
 * Some effects, like the fragment shader based effects, can only use GL
 * textures, and in order to apply those effects to any kind of actor they
 * require that all drawing operations are applied to an offscreen framebuffer
 * that gets redirected to a texture.
 *
 * #ClutterOffscreenEffect provides all the heavy-lifting for creating the
 * offscreen framebuffer, the redirection and the final paint of the texture on
 * the desired stage.
 *
 * #ClutterOffscreenEffect is available since Clutter 1.4
 *
 * ## Implementing a ClutterOffscreenEffect
 *
 * Creating a sub-class of #ClutterOffscreenEffect requires, in case
 * of overriding the #ClutterEffect virtual functions, to chain up to the
 * #ClutterOffscreenEffect's implementation.
 *
 * On top of the #ClutterEffect's virtual functions,
 * #ClutterOffscreenEffect also provides a #ClutterOffscreenEffectClass.paint_target()
 * function, which encapsulates the effective painting of the texture that
 * contains the result of the offscreen redirection.
 *
 * The size of the target material is defined to be as big as the
 * transformed size of the #ClutterActor using the offscreen effect.
 * Sub-classes of #ClutterOffscreenEffect can change the texture creation
 * code to provide bigger textures by overriding the
 * #ClutterOffscreenEffectClass.create_texture() virtual function; no chain up
 * to the #ClutterOffscreenEffect implementation is required in this
 * case.
