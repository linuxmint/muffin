/**
 * SECTION:clutter-gesture-action
 * @Title: ClutterGestureAction
 * @Short_Description: Action for gesture gestures
 *
 * #ClutterGestureAction is a sub-class of #ClutterAction that implements
 * the logic for recognizing gesture gestures. It listens for low level events
 * such as #ClutterButtonEvent and #ClutterMotionEvent on the stage to raise
 * the #ClutterGestureAction::gesture-begin, #ClutterGestureAction::gesture-progress,
 * and #ClutterGestureAction::gesture-end signals.
 *
 * To use #ClutterGestureAction you just need to apply it to a #ClutterActor
 * using clutter_actor_add_action() and connect to the signals:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   ClutterAction *action = clutter_gesture_action_new ();
 *
 *   clutter_actor_add_action (actor, action);
 *
 *   g_signal_connect (action, "gesture-begin", G_CALLBACK (on_gesture_begin), NULL);
 *   g_signal_connect (action, "gesture-progress", G_CALLBACK (on_gesture_progress), NULL);
 *   g_signal_connect (action, "gesture-end", G_CALLBACK (on_gesture_end), NULL);
 * ]|
 *
 * ## Creating Gesture actions
 *
 * A #ClutterGestureAction provides four separate states that can be
 * used to recognize or ignore gestures when writing a new action class:
 *
 *  - Prepare -> Cancel
 *  - Prepare -> Begin -> Cancel
 *  - Prepare -> Begin -> End
 *  - Prepare -> Begin -> Progress -> Cancel
 *  - Prepare -> Begin -> Progress -> End
 *
 * Each #ClutterGestureAction starts in the "prepare" state, and calls
 * the #ClutterGestureActionClass.gesture_prepare() virtual function; this
 * state can be used to reset the internal state of a #ClutterGestureAction
 * subclass, but it can also immediately cancel a gesture without going
 * through the rest of the states.
 *
 * The "begin" state follows the "prepare" state, and calls the
 * #ClutterGestureActionClass.gesture_begin() virtual function. This state
 * signals the start of a gesture recognizing process. From the "begin" state
 * the gesture recognition process can successfully end, by going to the
 * "end" state; it can continue in the "progress" state, in case of a
 * continuous gesture; or it can be terminated, by moving to the "cancel"
 * state.
 *
 * In case of continuous gestures, the #ClutterGestureAction will use
 * the "progress" state, calling the #ClutterGestureActionClass.gesture_progress()
 * virtual function; the "progress" state will continue until the end of the
 * gesture, in which case the "end" state will be reached, or until the
 * gesture is cancelled, in which case the "cancel" gesture will be used
 * instead.
 *
 * Since: 1.8
