/**
 * SECTION:clutter-stage
 * @short_description: Top level visual element to which actors are placed.
 *
 * #ClutterStage is a top level 'window' on which child actors are placed
 * and manipulated.
 *
 * Backends might provide support for multiple stages. The support for this
 * feature can be checked at run-time using the clutter_feature_available()
 * function and the %CLUTTER_FEATURE_STAGE_MULTIPLE flag. If the backend used
 * supports multiple stages, new #ClutterStage instances can be created
 * using clutter_stage_new(). These stages must be managed by the developer
 * using clutter_actor_destroy(), which will take care of destroying all the
 * actors contained inside them.
 *
 * #ClutterStage is a proxy actor, wrapping the backend-specific implementation
 * (a #StageWindow) of the windowing system. It is possible to subclass
 * #ClutterStage, as long as every overridden virtual function chains up to the
 * parent class corresponding function.

/* This calculates a distance into the view frustum to position the
 * stage so there is a decent amount of space to position geometry
 * between the stage and the near clipping plane.
 *
 * Some awkward issues with this problem are:
 * - It's not possible to have a gap as large as the stage size with
 *   a fov > 53° which is basically always the case since the default
 *   fov is 60°.
 *    - This can be deduced if you consider that this requires a
 *      triangle as wide as it is deep to fit in the frustum in front
 *      of the z_near plane. That triangle will always have an angle
 *      of 53.13° at the point sitting on the z_near plane, but if the
 *      frustum has a wider fov angle the left/right clipping planes
 *      can never converge with the two corners of our triangle no
 *      matter what size the triangle has.
 * - With a fov > 53° there is a trade off between maximizing the gap
 *   size relative to the stage size but not loosing depth precision.
 * - Perhaps ideally we wouldn't just consider the fov on the y-axis
 *   that is usually used to define a perspective, we would consider
 *   the fov of the axis with the largest stage size so the gap would
 *   accommodate that size best.
 *
 * After going around in circles a few times with how to handle these
 * issues, we decided in the end to go for the simplest solution to
 * start with instead of an elaborate function that handles arbitrary
 * fov angles that we currently have no use-case for.
 *
 * The solution assumes a fovy of 60° and for that case gives a gap
 * that's 85% of the stage height. We can consider more elaborate
 * functions if necessary later.
 *
 * One guide we had to steer the gap size we support is the
 * interactive test, test-texture-quality which expects to animate an
 * actor to +400 on the z axis with a stage size of 640x480. A gap
 * that's 85% of the stage height gives a gap of 408 in that case.

   * The area of interest is the triangle labeled (1) at the top left
   * marked with the ... line (a) from where the origin line crosses
   * the near plane to the top left where the stage line cross the
   * left clip plane.
   *
   * The sides of the triangle are a, b and c and the corresponding
   * angles opposite those sides are A, B and C.
   *
   * The angle of C is what trades off the gap size we have relative
   * to the stage size vs the depth precision we have.
   *
   * As mentioned above we arove at the angle for C is by working
   * backwards from how much space we want for test-texture-quality.
   * With a stage_height of 480 we want a gap > 400, ideally we also
   * wanted a somewhat round number as a percentage of the height for
   * documentation purposes. ~87% or a gap of ~416 is the limit
   * because that's where we approach a C angle of 0° and effectively
   * loose all depth precision.
   *
   * So for our test app with a stage_height of 480 if we aim for a
   * gap of 408 (85% of 480) we can get the angle D as
   * atan (stage_height/2/408) = 30.5°.
   *
   * That gives us the angle for B as 90° - 30.5° = 59.5°
   *
   * We can already determine that A has an angle of (fovy/2 + 90°) =
   * 120°
   *
   * Therefore C = 180 - A - B = 0.5°
   *
   * The length of c = z_near * tan (30°)
   *
   * Now we can use the rule a/SinA = c/SinC to calculate the
   * length of a. After some rearranging that gives us:
   *
   *      a              c
   *  ----------  =  ----------
   *  sin (120°)     sin (0.5°)
   *
   *      c * sin (120°)
   *  a = --------------
   *        sin (0.5°)
   *
   * And with that we can determine z_2d = cos (D) * a =
   * cos (30.5°) * a + z_near:
   *
   *         c * sin (120°) * cos (30.5°)
   *  z_2d = --------------------------- + z_near
   *                 sin (0.5°)
