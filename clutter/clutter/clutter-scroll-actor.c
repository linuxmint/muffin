/**
 * SECTION:clutter-scroll-actor
 * @Title: ClutterScrollActor
 * @Short_Description: An actor for displaying a portion of its children
 *
 * #ClutterScrollActor is an actor that can be used to display a portion
 * of the contents of its children.
 *
 * The extent of the area of a #ClutterScrollActor is defined by the size
 * of its children; the visible region of the children of a #ClutterScrollActor
 * is set by using clutter_scroll_actor_scroll_to_point() or by using
 * clutter_scroll_actor_scroll_to_rect() to define a point or a rectangle
 * acting as the origin, respectively.
 *
 * #ClutterScrollActor does not provide pointer or keyboard event handling,
 * nor does it provide visible scroll handles.
 *
 * See [scroll-actor.c](https://git.gnome.org/browse/clutter/tree/examples/scroll-actor.c?h=clutter-1.18)
 * for an example of how to use #ClutterScrollActor.
 *
 * #ClutterScrollActor is available since Clutter 1.12.
