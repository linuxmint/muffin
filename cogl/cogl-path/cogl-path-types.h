 * CoglPathFillRule:
 * @COGL_PATH_FILL_RULE_NON_ZERO: Each time the line crosses an edge of
 * the path from left to right one is added to a counter and each time
 * it crosses from right to left the counter is decremented. If the
 * counter is non-zero then the point will be filled. See <xref
 * linkend="fill-rule-non-zero"/>.
 * @COGL_PATH_FILL_RULE_EVEN_ODD: If the line crosses an edge of the
 * path an odd number of times then the point will filled, otherwise
 * it won't. See <xref linkend="fill-rule-even-odd"/>.
 *
 * #CoglPathFillRule is used to determine how a path is filled. There
 * are two options - 'non-zero' and 'even-odd'. To work out whether any
 * point will be filled imagine drawing an infinetely long line in any
 * direction from that point. The number of times and the direction
 * that the edges of the path crosses this line determines whether the
 * line is filled as described below. Any open sub paths are treated
 * as if there was an extra line joining the first point and the last
 * point.
 *
 * The default fill rule when creating a path is %COGL_PATH_FILL_RULE_EVEN_ODD.
