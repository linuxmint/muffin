 *
 * The recommended way to take advantage of this buffer age api is to

 * buffer and the application should redraw it to repair the buffer.
 * For example this may happen in a window system without a compositor
 * if a window that was previously covering up the onscreen window has
 * been moved causing a region of the onscreen to be exposed.
 *
 * The @callback will be passed a #CoglOnscreenDirtyInfo struct which
 * decribes a rectangle containing the newly dirtied region. Note that
 * this may be called multiple times to describe a non-rectangular
 * region composed of multiple smaller rectangles.
 *
 * The dirty events are separate from %COGL_FRAME_EVENT_SYNC events so
 * the application should also listen for this event before rendering
 * the dirty region to ensure that the framebuffer is actually ready
