/**
 * SECTION:cogl-output
 * @short_description: information about an output device
 *
 * The #CoglOutput object holds information about an output device
 * such as a monitor or laptop display. It can be queried to find
 * out the position of the output with respect to the screen
 * coordinate system and other information such as the resolution
 * and refresh rate of the device.
 *
 * There can be any number of outputs which may overlap: the
 * same area of the screen may be displayed by multiple output
 * devices.
 *
 * XXX: though it's possible to query the position of the output
 * with respect to screen coordinates, there is currently no way
 * of finding out the position of a #CoglOnscreen in screen
 * coordinates, at least without using windowing-system specific
 * API's, so it's not easy to get the output positions relative
 * to the #CoglOnscreen.
