 *
 * CoglMagazine provides a really light weight allocator for chunks
 * of memory with a pre-determined size.
 *
 * This allocator builds on CoglMemoryStack for making all initial
 * allocations but never frees memory back to the stack.
 *
 * Memory chunks that haven't been allocated yet are stored in a
 * singly linked, fifo, list.
 *
 * Allocating from a magazine is simply a question of popping an entry
 * from the head of the fifo list. If no entries are available then
 * instead allocate from the memory stack instead.
 *
 * When an entry is freed, it is put back into the fifo list for
 * re-use.
 *
 * No attempt is ever made to shrink the amount of memory associated
 * with a CoglMagazine.
