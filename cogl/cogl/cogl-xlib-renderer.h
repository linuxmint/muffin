 *
 * The extension is only useful when running on certain versions of

 *
 * "The NVIDIA OpenGL driver architecture on Linux has a limitation:
 *  resources located in video memory are not persistent across certain
 *  events. VT switches, suspend/resume events, and mode switching
 *  events may erase the contents of video memory. Any resource that
 *  is located exclusively in video memory, such as framebuffer objects
 *  (FBOs), will be lost."
 *
 * "This extension provides a way for applications to discover when video
 *  memory content has been lost, so that the application can re-populate
 *  the video memory content as necessary."
 *
 * "Any driver that exposes this extension is a driver that considers
 *  video memory to be volatile. Once the driver stack has been
 *  improved, the extension will no longer be exposed."
 *
 * cogl_get_graphics_reset_status() needs to be called at least once
 * every frame to find out if video memory was purged.
 *
 * Note that this doesn't cause Cogl to enable robust buffer access
 * but other context reset errors may still happen and be reported via
 * cogl_get_graphics_reset_status() if external factors cause the
 * driver to trigger them.
 *
 * This defaults to %FALSE and is effective only if called before
 * cogl_display_setup() .
