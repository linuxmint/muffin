/* We've made a notable change to the original algorithm referenced
 * above to make sure we have reliable results for screen aligned
 * rectangles even though there may be some numerical in-precision in
 * how the vertices of the polygon were calculated.
 *
 * We've avoided introducing an epsilon factor to the comparisons
 * since we feel there's a risk of changing some semantics in ways that
 * might not be desirable. One of those is that if you transform two
 * polygons which share an edge and test a point close to that edge
 * then this algorithm will currently give a positive result for only
 * one polygon.
 *
 * Another concern is the way this algorithm resolves the corner case
 * where the horizontal ray being cast to count edge crossings may
 * cross directly through a vertex. The solution is based on the "idea
 * of Simulation of Simplicity" and "pretends to shift the ray
 * infinitesimally down so that it either clearly intersects, or
 * clearly doesn't touch". I'm not familiar with the idea myself so I
 * expect a misplaced epsilon is likely to break that aspect of the
 * algorithm.
 *
 * The simple solution we've gone for is to pixel align the polygon
 * vertices which should eradicate most noise due to in-precision.
