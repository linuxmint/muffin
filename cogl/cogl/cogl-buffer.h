/**
 * SECTION:cogl-buffer
 * @short_description: Common buffer functions, including data upload APIs
 * @stability: unstable
 *
 * The CoglBuffer API provides a common interface to manipulate
 * buffers that have been allocated either via cogl_pixel_buffer_new()
 * or cogl_attribute_buffer_new(). The API allows you to upload data
 * to these buffers and define usage hints that help Cogl manage your
 * buffer optimally.
 *
 * Data can either be uploaded by supplying a pointer and size so Cogl
 * can copy your data, or you can mmap() a CoglBuffer and then you can
 * copy data to the buffer directly.
 *
 * One of the most common uses for CoglBuffers is to upload texture
 * data asynchronously since the ability to mmap the buffers into
 * the CPU makes it possible for another thread to handle the IO
 * of loading an image file and unpacking it into the mapped buffer
 * without blocking other Cogl operations.
