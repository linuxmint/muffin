/**
 * SECTION:cogl-indices
 * @short_description: Describe vertex indices stored in a #CoglIndexBuffer.
 *
 * Indices allow you to avoid duplicating vertices in your vertex data
 * by virtualizing your data and instead providing a sequence of index
 * values that tell the GPU which data should be used for each vertex.
 *
 * If the GPU is given a sequence of indices it doesn't simply walk
 * through each vertex of your data in order it will instead walk
 * through the indices which can provide random access to the
 * underlying data.
 *
 * Since it's very common to have duplicate vertices when describing a
 * shape as a list of triangles it can often be a significant space
 * saving to describe geometry using indices. Reducing the size of
 * your models can make it cheaper to map them into the GPU by
 * reducing the demand on memory bandwidth and may help to make better
 * use of your GPUs internal vertex caching.
 *
 * For example, to describe a quadrilateral as 2 triangles for the GPU
 * you could either provide data with 6 vertices or instead with
 * indices you can provide vertex data for just 4 vertices and an
 * index buffer that specfies the 6 vertices by indexing the shared
 * vertices multiple times.
 *
 * |[
 *   CoglVertexP2 quad_vertices[] = {
 *     {x0, y0}, //0 = top left
 *     {x1, y1}, //1 = bottom left
 *     {x2, y2}, //2 = bottom right
 *     {x3, y3}, //3 = top right
 *   };
 *   //tell the gpu how to interpret the quad as 2 triangles...
 *   unsigned char indices[] = {0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 3};
 * ]|
 *
 * Even in the above illustration we see a saving of 10bytes for one
 * quad compared to having data for 6 vertices and no indices but if
 * you need to draw 100s or 1000s of quads then its really quite
 * significant.
 *
 * Something else to consider is that often indices can be defined
 * once and remain static while the vertex data may change for
 * animations perhaps. That means you may be able to ignore the
 * negligable cost of mapping your indices into the GPU if they don't
 * ever change.
 *
 * The above illustration is actually a good example of static indices
 * because it's really common that developers have quad mesh data that
 * they need to display and we know exactly what that indices array
 * needs to look like depending on the number of quads that need to be
 * drawn. It doesn't matter how the quads might be animated and
 * changed the indices will remain the same. Cogl even has a utility
 * (cogl_get_rectangle_indices()) to get access to re-useable indices
 * for drawing quads as above.
