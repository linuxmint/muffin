 * processing. This can be used as a convenience instead of
 * cogl_poll_renderer_get_info() and cogl_poll_renderer_dispatch() in
 * applications that are already using the GLib main loop. After this
 * is called the #GSource should be attached to the main loop using

 *
 * Applications that manually connect to a #CoglRenderer before they
 * create a #CoglContext should instead use
 * cogl_glib_renderer_source_new() so that events may be dispatched
 * before a context has been created. In that case you don't need to
 * use this api in addition later, it is simply enough to use
 * cogl_glib_renderer_source_new() instead.
