/**
 * SECTION:cogl-framebuffer
 * @short_description: A common interface for manipulating framebuffers
 *
 * Framebuffers are a collection of buffers that can be rendered too.
 * A framebuffer may be comprised of one or more color buffers, an
 * optional depth buffer and an optional stencil buffer. Other
 * configuration parameters are associated with framebuffers too such
 * as whether the framebuffer supports multi-sampling (an anti-aliasing
 * technique) or dithering.
 *
 * There are two kinds of framebuffer in Cogl, #CoglOnscreen
 * framebuffers and #CoglOffscreen framebuffers. As the names imply
 * offscreen framebuffers are for rendering something offscreen
 * (perhaps to a texture which is bound as one of the color buffers).
 * The exact semantics of onscreen framebuffers depends on the window
 * system backend that you are using, but typically you can expect
 * rendering to a #CoglOnscreen framebuffer will be immediately
 * visible to the user.
 *
 * If you want to create a new framebuffer then you should start by
 * looking at the #CoglOnscreen and #CoglOffscreen constructor
 * functions, such as cogl_offscreen_new_with_texture() or
 * cogl_onscreen_new(). The #CoglFramebuffer interface deals with
 * all aspects that are common between those two types of framebuffer.
 *
 * Setup of a new CoglFramebuffer happens in two stages. There is a
 * configuration stage where you specify all the options and ancillary
 * buffers you want associated with your framebuffer and then when you
 * are happy with the configuration you can "allocate" the framebuffer
 * using cogl_framebuffer_allocate(). Technically explicitly calling
 * cogl_framebuffer_allocate() is optional for convenience and the
 * framebuffer will automatically be allocated when you first try to
 * draw to it, but if you do the allocation manually then you can
 * also catch any possible errors that may arise from your
 * configuration.

 * ignored.
 *
 * The function also doesn't support specifying the buffers to copy
 * and instead only the color buffer is copied. When copying the depth
 * or stencil buffers the extension on GLES2.0 only supports copying
 * the full buffer which would be awkward to document with this
 * API. If we wanted to support that feature it may be better to have
 * a separate function to copy the entire buffer for a given mask.
 *
 * The @c error argument is optional, it can be NULL. If it is not NULL
 * and this function returns FALSE, an error object with a code from
