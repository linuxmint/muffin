/**
 * SECTION:cogl-matrix-stack
 * @short_description: Functions for efficiently tracking many
 *                     related transformations
 *
 * Matrices can be used (for example) to describe the model-view
 * transforms of objects, texture transforms, and projective
 * transforms.
 *
 * The #CoglMatrix api provides a good way to manipulate individual
 * matrices representing a single transformation but if you need to
 * track many-many such transformations for many objects that are
 * organized in a scenegraph for example then using a separate
 * #CoglMatrix for each object may not be the most efficient way.
 *
 * A #CoglMatrixStack enables applications to track lots of
 * transformations that are related to each other in some kind of
 * hierarchy.  In a scenegraph for example if you want to know how to
 * transform a particular node then you usually have to walk up
 * through the ancestors and accumulate their transforms before
 * finally applying the transform of the node itself. In this model
 * things are grouped together spatially according to their ancestry
 * and all siblings with the same parent share the same initial
 * transformation. The #CoglMatrixStack API is suited to tracking lots
 * of transformations that fit this kind of model.
 *
 * Compared to using the #CoglMatrix api directly to track many
 * related transforms, these can be some advantages to using a
 * #CoglMatrixStack:
 * <itemizedlist>
 *   <listitem>Faster equality comparisons of transformations</listitem>
 *   <listitem>Efficient comparisons of the differences between arbitrary
 *   transformations</listitem>
 *   <listitem>Avoid redundant arithmetic related to common transforms
 *   </listitem>
 *   <listitem>Can be more space efficient (not always though)</listitem>
 * </itemizedlist>
 *
 * For reference (to give an idea of when a #CoglMatrixStack can
 * provide a space saving) a #CoglMatrix can be expected to take 72
 * bytes whereas a single #CoglMatrixEntry in a #CoglMatrixStack is
 * currently around 32 bytes on a 32bit CPU or 36 bytes on a 64bit
 * CPU. An entry is needed for each individual operation applied to
 * the stack (such as rotate, scale, translate) so if most of your
 * leaf node transformations only need one or two simple operations
 * relative to their parent then a matrix stack will likely take less
 * space than having a #CoglMatrix for each node.
 *
 * Even without any space saving though the ability to perform fast
 * comparisons and avoid redundant arithmetic (especially sine and
 * cosine calculations for rotations) can make using a matrix stack
 * worthwhile.

/**
 * CoglMatrixStack:
 *
 * Tracks your current position within a hierarchy and lets you build
 * up a graph of transformations as you traverse through a hierarchy
 * such as a scenegraph.
 *
 * A #CoglMatrixStack always maintains a reference to a single
 * transformation at any point in time, representing the
 * transformation at the current position in the hierarchy. You can
 * get a reference to the current transformation by calling
 * cogl_matrix_stack_get_entry().
 *
 * When a #CoglMatrixStack is first created with
 * cogl_matrix_stack_new() then it is conceptually positioned at the
 * root of your hierarchy and the current transformation simply
 * represents an identity transformation.
 *
 * As you traverse your object hierarchy (your scenegraph) then you
 * should call cogl_matrix_stack_push() whenever you move down one
 * level and call cogl_matrix_stack_pop() whenever you move back up
 * one level towards the root.
 *
 * At any time you can apply a set of operations, such as "rotate",
 * "scale", "translate" on top of the current transformation of a
 * #CoglMatrixStack using functions such as
 * cogl_matrix_stack_rotate(), cogl_matrix_stack_scale() and
 * cogl_matrix_stack_translate(). These operations will derive a new
 * current transformation and will never affect a transformation
 * that you have referenced using cogl_matrix_stack_get_entry().
 *
 * Internally applying operations to a #CoglMatrixStack builds up a
 * graph of #CoglMatrixEntry structures which each represent a single
 * immutable transform.

/**
 * CoglMatrixEntry:
 *
 * Represents a single immutable transformation that was retrieved
 * from a #CoglMatrixStack using cogl_matrix_stack_get_entry().
 *
 * Internally a #CoglMatrixEntry represents a single matrix
 * operation (such as "rotate", "scale", "translate") which is applied
 * to the transform of a single parent entry.
 *
 * Using the #CoglMatrixStack api effectively builds up a graph of
 * these immutable #CoglMatrixEntry structures whereby operations
 * that can be shared between multiple transformations will result
 * in shared #CoglMatrixEntry nodes in the graph.
 *
 * When a #CoglMatrixStack is first created it references one
 * #CoglMatrixEntry that represents a single "load identity"
 * operation. This serves as the root entry and all operations
 * that are then applied to the stack will extend the graph
 * starting from this root "load identity" entry.
 *
 * Given the typical usage model for a #CoglMatrixStack and the way
 * the entries are built up while traversing a scenegraph then in most
 * cases where an application is interested in comparing two
 * transformations for equality then it is enough to simply compare
 * two #CoglMatrixEntry pointers directly. Technically this can lead
 * to false negatives that could be identified with a deeper
 * comparison but often these false negatives are unlikely and
 * don't matter anyway so this enables extremely cheap comparisons.
