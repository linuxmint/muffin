/* The clip stack works like a GSList where only a pointer to the top
   of the stack is stored. The empty clip stack is represented simply
   by the NULL pointer. When an entry is added to or removed from the
   stack the new top of the stack is returned. When an entry is pushed
   a new clip stack entry is created which effectively takes ownership
   of the reference on the old entry. Therefore unrefing the top entry
   effectively loses ownership of all entries in the stack */

/* A clip stack consists a list of entries. Each entry has a reference

 * children. This allows stacks that have common ancestry to share the
 * entries.

 * the tree below:
 *
 * CoglClipStack *stack_a = NULL;
 * stack_a = _cogl_clip_stack_push_rectangle (stack_a, ...);
 * stack_a = _cogl_clip_stack_push_rectangle (stack_a, ...);
