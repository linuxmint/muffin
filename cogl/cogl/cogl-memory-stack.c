 * CoglMemoryStack provides a really simple, but lightning fast
 * memory stack allocation strategy:
 *
 * - The underlying pool of memory is grow-only.
 * - The pool is considered to be a stack which may be comprised
 *   of multiple smaller stacks. Allocation is done as follows:
 *    - If there's enough memory in the current sub-stack then the
 *      stack-pointer will be returned as the allocation and the
 *      stack-pointer will be incremented by the allocation size.
 *    - If there isn't enough memory in the current sub-stack
 *      then a new sub-stack is allocated twice as big as the current
 *      sub-stack or twice as big as the requested allocation size if
 *      that's bigger and the stack-pointer is set to the start of the
 *      new sub-stack.
 * - Allocations can't be freed in a random-order, you can only
 *   rewind the entire stack back to the start. There is no
 *   the concept of stack frames to allow partial rewinds.
 *
 * For example; we plan to use this in our tesselator which has to
 * allocate lots of small vertex, edge and face structures because
 * when tesselation has been finished we just want to free the whole
 * lot in one go.
