 * @short_description: Functions for initializing and manipulating 4x4 matrices
 *
 * Matrices are used in Cogl to describe affine model-view transforms, texture
 * transforms, and projective transforms. This exposes a utility API that can
 * be used for direct manipulation of these matrices.
 */

/**
 * CoglMatrix:
 *
 * A CoglMatrix holds a 4x4 transform matrix. This is a single precision,
 * column-major matrix which means it is compatible with what OpenGL expects.
 *
 * A CoglMatrix can represent transforms such as, rotations, scaling,
 * translation, sheering, and linear projections. You can combine these
 * transforms by multiplying multiple matrices in the order you want them
 * applied.
 *
 * The transformation of a vertex (x, y, z, w) by a CoglMatrix is given by:
 *
 * |[
 *   x_new = xx * x + xy * y + xz * z + xw * w
 *   y_new = yx * x + yy * y + yz * z + yw * w
 *   z_new = zx * x + zy * y + zz * z + zw * w
 *   w_new = wx * x + wy * y + wz * z + ww * w
 * ]|
 *
 * Where w is normally 1
 *
 * <note>You must consider the members of the CoglMatrix structure read only,
 * and all matrix modifications must be done via the cogl_matrix API. This
 * allows Cogl to annotate the matrices internally. Violation of this will give
 * undefined results. If you need to initialize a matrix with a constant other
 * than the identity matrix you can use cogl_matrix_init_from_array().</note>

 * the input array to do the transform in-place.

 *   uint8_t r,g,b,a;
 *   float s,t,p;
 * } MyInVertex;

 * } MyOutVertex;
 * MyInVertex vertices[N_VERTICES];
