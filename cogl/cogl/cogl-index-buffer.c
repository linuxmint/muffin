 * track meta data such as the indices type and max_index_value for a
 * range as part of the indices buffer. If we just leave people to use
 * cogl_buffer_set_data then we either need a way to specify the type
 * and max index value at draw time or we'll want a separate way to
 * declare the type and max value for a range after uploading the
 * data.
 *
 * XXX: I think in the end it'll be that CoglIndices are to
 * CoglIndexBuffers as CoglAttributes are to CoglAttributeBuffers. I.e
 * a CoglIndexBuffer is a lite subclass of CoglBuffer that simply
 * implies that the buffer will later be bound as indices but doesn't
 * track more detailed meta data. CoglIndices build on a
 * CoglIndexBuffer and define the type and max_index_value for some
 * sub-range of a CoglIndexBuffer.
