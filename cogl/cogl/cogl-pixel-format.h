 * @short_description: Pixel formats supported by Cogl
 *
 * The pixel format of an image descrbes how the bits of each pixel are
 * represented in memory. For example: an image can be laid out as one long
 * sequence of pixels, where each pixel is a sequence of 8 bits of Red, Green
 * and Blue. The amount of bits that are used can be different for each pixel
 * format, as well as the components (for example an Alpha layer to include
 * transparency, or non_RGBA).
 *
 * Other examples of factors that can influence the layout in memory are the
 * system's endianness.

/* XXX: Notes to those adding new formats here...
 *
 * First this diagram outlines how we allocate the 32bits of a
 * CoglPixelFormat currently...
 *
 *                            6 bits for flags
 *                          |-----|
 *  enum        unused             4 bits for the bytes-per-pixel
 *                                 and component alignment info
 *  |------| |-------------|       |--|
 *  00000000 xxxxxxxx xxxxxxSD PFBA0000
 *                          ^ stencil
 *                           ^ depth
 *                             ^ premult
 *                              ^ alpha first
 *                               ^ bgr order
 *                                ^ has alpha
 *
 * The most awkward part about the formats is how we use the last 4
 * bits to encode the bytes per pixel and component alignment
 * information. Ideally we should have had 3 bits for the bpp and a
 * flag for alignment but we didn't plan for that in advance so we
 * instead use a small lookup table to query the bpp and whether the
 * components are byte aligned or not.
 *
 * The mapping is the following (see discussion on bug #660188):
 *
 * 0     = undefined
 * 1, 8  = 1 bpp (e.g. A_8, G_8)
 * 2     = 3 bpp, aligned (e.g. 888)
 * 3     = 4 bpp, aligned (e.g. 8888)
 * 4-6   = 2 bpp, not aligned (e.g. 565, 4444, 5551)
 * 7     = YUV: undefined bpp, undefined alignment
 * 9     = 2 bpp, aligned
 * 10    = depth, aligned (8, 16, 24, 32, 32f)
 * 11    = undefined
 * 12    = 3 bpp, not aligned
 * 13    = 4 bpp, not aligned (e.g. 2101010)
 * 14-15 = undefined
 *
 * Note: the gap at 10-11 is just because we wanted to maintain that
 * all non-aligned formats have the third bit set in case that's
 * useful later.
 *
 * Since we don't want to waste bits adding more and more flags, we'd
 * like to see most new pixel formats that can't be represented
 * uniquely with the existing flags in the least significant byte
 * simply be enumerated with sequential values in the most significant
 * enum byte.
 *
 * Note: Cogl avoids exposing any padded XRGB or RGBX formats and
 * instead we leave it up to applications to decided whether they
 * consider the A component as padding or valid data. We shouldn't
 * change this policy without good reasoning.
 *
 * So to add a new format:
 * 1) Use the mapping table above to figure out what to but in
 *    the lowest nibble.
 * 2) OR in the COGL_PREMULT_BIT, COGL_AFIRST_BIT, COGL_A_BIT and
 *    COGL_BGR_BIT flags as appropriate.
 * 3) If the result is not yet unique then also combine with an
 *    increment of the last sequence number in the most significant
 *    byte.
 *
 * The last sequence number used was 0 (i.e. no formats currently need
 *                                      a sequence number)
 * Update this note whenever a new sequence number is used.

 * Pixel formats used by Cogl. For the formats with a byte per
 * component, the order of the components specify the order in
 * increasing memory addresses. So for example
 * %COGL_PIXEL_FORMAT_RGB_888 would have the red component in the
 * lowest address, green in the next address and blue after that
 * regardless of the endianness of the system.
 *
 * For the formats with non byte aligned components the component
 * order specifies the order within a 16-bit or 32-bit number from
 * most significant bit to least significant. So for
 * %COGL_PIXEL_FORMAT_RGB_565, the red component would be in bits
 * 11-15, the green component would be in 6-11 and the blue component
 * would be in 1-5. Therefore the order in memory depends on the
 * endianness of the system.
 *
 * When uploading a texture %COGL_PIXEL_FORMAT_ANY can be used as the
 * internal format. Cogl will try to pick the best format to use
 * internally and convert the texture data if necessary.
 *
 * Since: 0.8
