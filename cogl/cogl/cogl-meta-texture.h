/**
 * SECTION:cogl-meta-texture
 * @short_description: Interface for high-level textures built from
 *                     low-level textures like #CoglTexture2D.
 *
 * Cogl helps to make it easy to deal with high level textures such
 * as #CoglAtlasTexture<!-- -->s, #CoglSubTexture<!-- -->s,
 * #CoglTexturePixmapX11 textures and #CoglTexture2DSliced textures
 * consistently.
 *
 * A #CoglMetaTexture is a texture that might internally be
 * represented by one or more low-level #CoglTexture<!-- -->s
 * such as #CoglTexture2D. These low-level textures are the only ones
 * that a GPU really understands but because applications often want
 * more high-level texture abstractions (such as storing multiple
 * textures inside one larger "atlas" texture) it's desirable to be
 * able to deal with these using a common interface.
 *
 * For example the GPU is not able to automatically handle repeating a
 * texture that is part of a larger atlas texture but if you use
 * %COGL_PIPELINE_WRAP_MODE_REPEAT with an atlas texture when drawing
 * with cogl_rectangle() you should see that it "Just Worksâ„¢" - at
 * least if you don't use multi-texturing. The reason this works is
 * because cogl_rectangle() internally understands the #CoglMetaTexture
 * interface and is able to manually resolve the low-level textures
 * using this interface and by making multiple draw calls it can
 * emulate the texture repeat modes.
 *
 * Cogl doesn't aim to pretend that meta-textures are just like real
 * textures because it would get extremely complex to try and emulate
 * low-level GPU semantics transparently for these textures.  The low
 * level drawing APIs of Cogl, such as cogl_primitive_draw() don't
 * actually know anything about the #CoglMetaTexture interface and its
 * the developer's responsibility to resolve all textures referenced
 * by a #CoglPipeline to low-level textures before drawing.
 *
 * If you want to develop custom primitive APIs like
 * cogl_framebuffer_draw_rectangle() and you want to support drawing
 * with #CoglAtlasTexture<!-- -->s or #CoglSubTexture<!-- -->s for
 * example, then you will need to use this #CoglMetaTexture interface
 * to be able to resolve high-level textures into low-level textures
 * before drawing with Cogl's low-level drawing APIs such as
 * cogl_primitive_draw().
 *
 * <note>Most developers won't need to use this interface directly
 * but still it is worth understanding the distinction between
 * low-level and meta textures because you may find other references
 * in the documentation that detail limitations of using
 * meta-textures.</note>

 *
 * Allows you to manually iterate the low-level textures that define a
 * given region of a high-level #CoglMetaTexture.
 *
 * For example cogl_texture_2d_sliced_new_with_size() can be used to
 * create a meta texture that may slice a large image into multiple,
 * smaller power-of-two sized textures. These high level textures are
 * not directly understood by a GPU and so this API must be used to
 * manually resolve the underlying textures for drawing.
 *
 * All high level textures (#CoglAtlasTexture, #CoglSubTexture,
 * #CoglTexturePixmapX11, and #CoglTexture2DSliced) can be handled
 * consistently using this interface which greately simplifies
 * implementing primitives that support all texture types.
 *
 * For example if you use the cogl_rectangle() API then Cogl will
 * internally use this API to resolve the low level textures of any
 * meta textures you have associated with CoglPipeline layers.
 *
 * <note>The low level drawing APIs such as cogl_primitive_draw()
 * don't understand the #CoglMetaTexture interface and so it is your
 * responsibility to use this API to resolve all CoglPipeline textures
 * into low-level textures before drawing.</note>
 *
 * For each low-level texture that makes up part of the given region
 * of the @meta_texture, @callback is called specifying how the
 * low-level texture maps to the original region.
