/**

 * @short_description: Functions for creating and manipulating the GPU
 *                     pipeline
 *
 * Cogl allows creating and manipulating objects representing the full
 * configuration of the GPU pipeline. In simplified terms the GPU
 * pipeline takes primitive geometry as the input, it first performs
 * vertex processing, allowing you to deform your geometry, then
 * rasterizes that (turning it from pure geometry into fragments) then
 * performs fragment processing including depth testing and texture
 * mapping. Finally it blends the result with the framebuffer.
