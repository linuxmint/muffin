/* This is included multiple times with different definitions for
 * these macros. The macros are given the following arguments:
 *
 * COGL_EXT_BEGIN:
 *
 * @name: a unique symbol name for this feature
 *
 * @min_gl_major: the major part of the minimum GL version where these
 * functions are available in core, or 255 if it isn't available in
 * any version.
 * @min_gl_minor: the minor part of the minimum GL version where these
 * functions are available in core, or 255 if it isn't available in
 * any version.
 *
 * @gles_availability: flags to specify which versions of GLES the
 * functions are available in. Should be a combination of
 * COGL_EXT_IN_GLES and COGL_EXT_IN_GLES2.
 *
 * @extension_suffixes: A zero-separated list of suffixes in a
 * string. These are appended to the extension name to get a complete
 * extension name to try. The suffix is also appended to all of the
 * function names. The suffix can optionally include a ':' to specify
 * an alternate suffix for the function names.
 *
 * @extension_names: A list of extension names to try. If any of these
 * extensions match then it will be used.
